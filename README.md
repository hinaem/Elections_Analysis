 #Overview of Election Audit
 
  In this Election audit I am helping Tom who works for the Board of Elections to get the total votes casted. There are three methods of how votes are collected; mail-in ballots, Punch Cards, Direct Recording Elections. If we are successful this will be used to audit other districts and more elections.

#Elections-Audit Summary
Based on this project given to me I highly request the Election Commission to use this method to determine the winner of any election. This method if done correctly can save a lot of time. Using the method there is many ways we can pin point very small details. Running Python codes in this we can see not only who won but we can see by how many votes and what percentage. Knowing these two parts of any elections is very important as well. Due to each candidate being different and placing their different views of the public voting is how they achieve one vote. It is a way we can see how much of a population is on whoes side. This script can be modified to run millions of people's votes and categorize them. Another thing about the script is there will not be any mistakes, it is accurate and fast.
